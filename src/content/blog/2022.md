# Portena: Revolutionizing Computing with Cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

As a developer at Cardano, my work involves monitoring the High Performance Cloud (HPC) market and providing cost-efficient solutions. During my monitoring of a ledger in Singapore, I stumbled upon an interesting observation: the RAM and processing power required for a remote desktop connection were surprisingly minimal, with only around **10MB of RAM** being consumed. This sparked the idea of **Portena**â€”a small single-board computer (SBC) with **100MB of RAM**, a **1GHz processor**, and an **LTE modem**.

The goal was to create a device that could connect to a cloud server and mirror its activities on a desktop screen using an HDMI/VGA cable. By renting and paying for only the required computing power on an hourly basis, we aimed to eliminate the need for a full computer and provide a **flexible** and **cost-effective** computing solution.

Traditional personal computing is plagued by inefficiencies. CPU utilization varies every second, leading to significant waste of computing power. Additionally, traditional PCs limit computational ability due to fixed hardware configurations, resulting in lag and performance degradation. These limitations often necessitate expensive hardware updates. Moreover, physical hardware introduces vulnerabilities to viruses, malware, and hacking, compromising sensitive information.

With Portena, we aim to address these issues by revolutionizing personal computing. By leveraging **cloud-based virtual desktop infrastructure**, we enable users to rent computational power on-demand, eliminating the need for physical hardware. Portena's **Elastic Allocation Model** utilizes container technology for dynamic resource allocation, optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. Users only pay for what they use on an hourly basis, providing a **sustainable** and **affordable** pricing model.

Our app offers a convenient payment system through the use of **computational credits**, allowing for easy budgeting and cost control.

## Portena's Potential

Portena's potential goes beyond traditional desktop computing. Its **portability** and **minimal hardware requirements** make it suitable for on-the-go use. As technology advances, we envision Portena's virtual computing concept extending to mobile and wearable devices. By relying on cloud computing and virtualization, devices can access remote computing power, enabling advanced features without the need for bulky hardware. With the arrival of **5G technology**, the near-zero latency between the device and the cloud opens up possibilities for **real-time streaming** of applications without noticeable lag. This makes Portena an ideal solution for various applications, ranging from education and gaming to business and personal use.

## Differentiation and Feasibility

Differentiating itself from existing solutions such as DaaS and thin clients, Portena offers a novel approach that is yet to be seen in the market. Our extensive market research has shown a gap waiting to be filled. From a technical standpoint, Portena's **lightweight hardware** and cloud-based virtual desktop infrastructure ensure scalability and efficiency. The elasticity and resource allocation model guarantee cost-effective usage, while LTE modems enable remote access from anywhere with internet connectivity. From a market perspective, the growing demand for **affordable** and **flexible** computing solutions, especially with the rise of remote work and education, makes Portena's model highly feasible.

## Seeking Support and Future Outlook

We are actively seeking mentors, investors, and incubators to support and guide us in bringing this idea to fruition and incubating it into a successful company. We believe that Portena has the potential to **transform** the computing landscape and offer users a **flexible**, **cost-effective**, and **secure** computing solution.

Thank you for your interest.
