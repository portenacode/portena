# Portena: Revolutionizing Remote Computing

Working as a volunteer for Cardano, I had the opportunity to delve into HPC (High-Performance Computing) markets, analyze their intricacies, and craft captivating custom marketplace images to share with the community. Amidst my monitoring of an HPC instance in Singapore, a thought ignited my curiosity: How much computing power is truly required to establish a remote connection to a desktop instance? To my astonishment, the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) task consumed a mere 10MB of RAM. This revelation piqued my interest as industry giants like VMware and Citrix presented DaaS (Desktop as a Service) and remote desktop solutions as alternatives, yet they necessitated a fully-fledged $500 computer. It struck me then: Why not create a diminutive microcontroller capable of serving as a client for a remote instance? And thus, the concept of Portena was born.

Our computational needs are often discrete, fluctuating between full capacity and merely a fraction thereof. Consider the scenario of an office employee utilizing a computer armed with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core processor; their computational requirements oscillate like a variable "x." At times, "x" may hover around 40%, while on other occasions, it might dwindle to a mere 10%. Regrettably, the surplus computing resource remains idle, going to waste.

Portena is meticulously designed to bridge this gap by connecting a small Single Board Computer (SBC) to a cloud server, mirroring its activities seamlessly on a desktop screen via an HDMI cable. Furthermore, Portena incorporates all the essential peripherals to empower users with effortless control over their Hybrid PCs. To establish the remote connection, I have developed a specially tailored protocol called uNet. Constructed upon TCPv8, uNet harnesses cutting-edge algorithms, ensuring high transmission rates with minimal latency. This protocol operates even in regions with limited internet connectivity, guaranteeing accessibility for users across the globe. Currently, I a, fully immersed in the prototyping phase, using the popular ESP32 microcontroller to develop a client-side solution while simultaneously working on the server-side implementation.

Portena's remote connection is facilitated through CoaaS (Compute-as-a-Service) infrastructures dispersed globally. These serverless models offer scalable "balloon-like" functions/containers that can be dynamically expanded or contracted to meet demand. Moreover, I have devised a distinctive plugin for each Portena instance, aptly named DRATP (Dynamic Resource Allocation and Task Prioritization). DRATP leverages AI/ML algorithms to optimize resource allocation and pricing, leading to cost reductions of up to 80%, as substantiated by my comprehensive tests.

Portena is still in its nascent ideation stages, and I have been ardently engrossed in prototyping, rigorous testing, and extensive research. For further insights into the remarkable technologies it embodies, please look at the blog section on our website.
